# LM-response-quality
method and software to improve quality of the response you get from your language model

Consider the observation: 
> *a given LM may forget to include some important items in the solution it generates (False Negative rate, FNR), BUT if we provide “hints” in the prompt, then the probability of FNR goes down to almost 0%.*

In other words, if we can reduce FNR, we will improve the quality of the LM response.

**A practical question is, where do we get such useful 'hints' in the first place, so that we include them in the prompt we are sending to the LM!**
